      <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Welcome to <strong>WhyTF Health</strong> (“we,” “our,” “us”).  
        This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your personal data when you visit <a href="https://whytfhealth.com">whytfhealth.com</a> or interact with our content, contact forms, or analytics tools.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are based in the European Union and comply with the <strong>General Data Protection Regulation (EU) 2016/679 (“GDPR”)</strong> and applicable data protection laws.  
        Our guiding principle is simple: we collect the least data necessary, store it securely, and never sell or misuse it.
      </p>

      <h2>2. Data We Collect</h2>
      <p>We collect only the information required to operate this website responsibly.</p>

      <h3>2.1 Information You Provide Voluntarily</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Contact Form:</strong> When you submit a message through our contact form, we receive your name, email address, and message content. This information is used solely to respond to your inquiry.</li>
        <li><strong>Email correspondence:</strong> If you contact us directly, we will store your message and contact details to follow up.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>2.2 Information Collected Automatically</h3>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Analytics:</strong> We use a privacy-friendly analytics provider (<a href="https://umami.is" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Umami</a>) that does <em>not</em> use cookies or personal identifiers. It collects anonymous data such as page views, browser type, country, and referring site.</li>
        <li><strong>Server logs:</strong> Our hosting provider automatically logs basic information (IP address, browser, date/time of access) to maintain website security. These logs are automatically purged after a short retention period.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>To respond to messages and feedback submitted via the contact form.</li>
        <li>To improve site content and technical performance using aggregated, non-personal analytics.</li>
        <li>To protect the security and integrity of our website.</li>
        <li>To comply with legal obligations or respond to lawful requests from public authorities, if required.</li>

      </ul>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>Contact form submissions are deleted within 12&nbsp;months of resolution, unless a longer retention is legally required.</li>
          <li>Server logs are retained for a maximum of 30&nbsp;days.</li>
          <li>Anonymous analytics data are stored in aggregated form indefinitely and cannot identify you.</li>
