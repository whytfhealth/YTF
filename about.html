  <h2 id="anatomy-idea">The Anatomy of an Idea — and the Curiosity Behind It</h2>

  <p>
    It began with a strange observation: that some of the most intelligent people in the world — the engineers who build systems, the strategists who move markets, the artists who turn thought into beauty — often know almost nothing about the bodies they live in.
  </p>

  <p>
    They can write code that predicts the future, or design machines that learn on their own, yet if you ask them why they couldn’t sleep last night, or why stress can twist their stomach into knots, they hesitate.
    It isn’t ignorance. It’s distance — a quiet divide between intelligence and being human.
  </p>

  <p>
    That divide was the seed of WhyTF Health.
    Because medicine, for all its wonder, is rarely taught in a way that invites people in. It’s either flattened into pop-science trivia or buried beneath terminology that even doctors joke about forgetting. Somewhere between those two extremes, curiosity dies.
  </p>

  <p>
    So this project was built to Bring Back Curiosity.
    To build a place where complexity isn’t the enemy, and understanding doesn’t require a degree. A place where the story of how your body works unfolds in layers — simple first, then deeper, until even the most intricate mechanism feels logical, even beautiful.
  </p>

  <p>
    We don’t oversimplify. We don’t overcomplicate. We translate.
  </p>

  <p>
    Every article is a ladder: you start with the big idea, climb step by step into the machinery, and reach the point where biology becomes story and science becomes sense. You choose how deep to go — and however far you go, you’ll understand.
  </p>

  <p>
    This isn’t just about teaching. It’s about returning medicine to the people it belongs to — everyone with a body and a question.
    If a medical student revises here, if a doctor sends a patient here, if a curious reader arrives here at 2 a.m. wondering why they can’t sleep — the idea is the same: knowledge should be clear, generous, and alive.
  </p>

  <p>
    That’s the anatomy of this idea — a curiosity that grew into structure, a single why that refused to stop asking.
    <br>Created by Adithya Arun, a medical student at Semmelweis University, Budapest.
