      <h2 id="anatomy-idea">The Anatomy of an Idea — Curiosity in Plain English</h2>
      <p>
        WhyTF Health began with ordinary questions smart people ask when life gets messy:
        <em>“Why couldn’t I sleep?”</em> “Why did that meal wreck my energy?” “Why does stress make my heart race?”
        Brilliant engineers, founders, teachers — people who run teams and ship complex systems — were guessing at their own biology.
        Not because they lacked the will to learn, but because the material they found was either flattened into feel-good oversimplifications or buried under jargon and grey prose.
      </p>
      <p>
        We set out to build a third path. Not shallow, not obtuse — layered.
        Start with the big picture in plain English; descend step-by-step into mechanisms; surface with clinical links and practical takeaways.
        At every rung, you decide how deep to go — and no matter how deep, the story still makes sense.
      </p>
      <p>
        The tone is human. The diagrams are mental pictures. The language respects both the science and the reader.
        This site is founded and written by me, with medical-student training and an editor’s obsession with clarity.
        When a topic demands specialist review, we’ll say so — and credit it.
      </p>
      <p>
        A note on the name: <strong>YTF stands for “Why That’s Fascinating.”</strong>
        Curiosity, not frustration. We’re here to make complex things click — and stay clicked.
