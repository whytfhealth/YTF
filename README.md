# WhyTF Health

**WhyTF Health** (short for *“Why That’s Fascinating Health”*) is a layered, accessible medical‑education project that explains how the human body works — from first principles to clinical depth — in plain English.

This site and podcast are built to make human biology make **sense**, not just facts to memorize. Each explainer starts simple enough for a curious reader and builds up until it’s exam‑ready for a med student.

## 🔬 Built for Everyone
- **Curious readers:** real understanding without jargon.  
- **Med students:** revise faster and explain better.  
- **Educators:** clear analogies for hard topics.

## 🧠 Project Focus
- Layered explainers: overview → mechanism → pathophysiology → clinical links.  
- Friendly tone: accurate, conversational, a little funny.  
- Open & free: ad‑supported only, never paywalled.

## 💻 Stack
Static site hosted via **GitHub Pages**, styled with plain CSS (dark + purple theme).
