      <h2 id="anatomy-idea">The Anatomy of an Idea — and the Curiosity Behind It</h2>
      <p>It began with a strange observation: that some of the most intelligent people in the world — the engineers who build systems, the strategists who move markets, the artists who turn thought into beauty — often know almost nothing about the bodies they live in.</p>
      <p>They can write code that predicts the future, or design machines that learn on their own, yet if you ask them <em>why they couldn’t sleep last night</em>, or <em>why stress can twist their stomach into knots</em>, they hesitate. It isn’t ignorance. It’s distance — a quiet divide between intelligence and being human.</p>
      <p>That divide was the seed of <strong>WhyTF Health</strong>. Because medicine, for all its wonder, is rarely taught in a way that invites people in. It’s either flattened into pop-science trivia or buried beneath terminology that even doctors joke about forgetting. Somewhere between those two extremes, curiosity dies.</p>
      <p>So this project was built to bring it back. To build a place where complexity isn’t the enemy, and understanding doesn’t require a degree. A place where the story of how your body works unfolds in layers — simple first, then deeper — until even the most intricate mechanism feels logical, even beautiful.</p>
      <p>We don’t oversimplify. We don’t overcomplicate. <strong>We translate.</strong></p>
      <p>Every article is a ladder: you start with the big idea, climb step by step into the machinery, and reach the point where biology becomes story and science becomes sense. <strong>You choose how deep to go</strong> — and however far you go, you’ll understand.</p>
      <p>This isn’t just about teaching. It’s about returning medicine to the people it belongs to — everyone with a body and a question. If a medical student revises here, if a doctor sends a patient here, if a curious reader arrives here at 2 a.m. wondering why they can’t sleep — the idea is the same: knowledge should be clear, generous, and alive.</p>
      <p>That’s the anatomy of this idea — a curiosity that grew into structure, a single <em>why</em> that refused to stop asking. <br><strong>Created and written by Adithya Arun.</strong></p>

      <p><strong>“WhyTF” is short for “Why That’s Fascinating.”</strong> It’s our reminder to chase the <em>fascination</em> in biology — to ask better questions, refuse lazy answers, and make the real mechanisms memorable.</p>

      <ul>
        <li><strong>Layered explainers:</strong> big idea → mechanisms → clinical links and practical takeaways.</li>
        <li><strong>Plain-English first:</strong> clarity without dumbing down — receptors, hormones, ion channels, feedback loops, made readable.</li>
        <li><strong>Sources & updates:</strong> every flagship piece cites primary texts/guidelines and shows “last updated.”</li>
        <li><strong>Respect for time:</strong> scannable structure, pull-outs, and read-time so you can go as deep as you need.</li>
      </ul>
